# NumPy Crash Course (From Scratch to Advanced in 2 Days)

This repository is a complete, fast-track NumPy learning path designed to build real data science skill — not just theoretical understanding.

The focus is on **vectorized thinking**, **clean numerical operations**, and **machine learning–ready data handling**.  
Everything is demonstrated in clear, structured Jupyter notebooks with short explanations and real-world examples.

## 📌 What You Will Learn
- How NumPy stores and handles data internally
- Creating and manipulating arrays (1D, 2D, and higher dimensions)
- Indexing, slicing, fancy indexing, and boolean filtering
- Mathematical & statistical operations on arrays
- Reshaping, flattening, transposing, and broadcasting
- Handling missing values and feature scaling for ML
- Vectorized programming (no loops)
- Matrix operations used in machine learning models
